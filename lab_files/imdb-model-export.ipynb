       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

Like in computer vision, we'll use a model pretrained on a bigger dataset (a cleaned subset of wikipedia called [wikitext-103](https://einstein.ai/research/blog/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset)). That model has been trained to guess what the next word is, its input being all the previous words. It has a recurrent structure and a hidden state that is updated each time it sees a new word. This hidden state thus contains information about the sentence up to that point.\n",

Because the English of the reviews left by people on IMDB isn't the same as the English of wikipedia, we'll need to adjust the parameters of our model by a little bit. Plus there might be some words that would be extremely common in the reviews dataset but would be barely present in wikipedia, and therefore might not be part of the vocabulary the model was trained on."

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the story this time is all about the espionage side of things . xxmaj with the xxmaj french army retreating in disarray from xxmaj spain , xxmaj major xxmaj ducos , the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round . xxmaj by pinning the murder of a xxmaj spanish xxmaj xxunk on xxmaj richard xxmaj sharpe , hero of the xxmaj british army , the fragile xxmaj british / xxmaj spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again . xxmaj when the xxmaj spanish nobles come to xxmaj wellington crying for xxmaj sharpe 's blood though , the xxmaj english general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and soon , he 's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot . xxmaj surprisingly enough for a xxmaj sharpe film as well , there 's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way , fancy that . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj what this results in of course is a more adventure style approach . xxmaj the concentration is less on the workings of the xxmaj english military with xxmaj sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside , dodging xxmaj french patrols , hob xxunk with the xxmaj spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions . xxmaj sergeant xxmaj harper , his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive . xxmaj strangely enough though , they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of xxmaj harper 's baby . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj this slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run . xxmaj and should anyone be worried that there wo n't be the standard battle at the climax fret not , because once again the poor old xxmaj french get a right kicking . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj ducos makes a fantastic successor to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate . xxmaj he is a duplicitous , malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of xxmaj raiders of the xxmaj lost xxmaj ark. xxmaj elsewhere , xxmaj hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you 'd want to deliver your first born , even if he does look like a member of xxmaj iron xxmaj maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj in short then , another strong chapter in the xxmaj sharpe series . xxmaj sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film . xxmaj it 's not the best introduction if you 've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to xxmaj sharpe that we do n't normally get to witness : the action hero rather than the professional soldier . xxmaj and if that 's not enough to get you tempted , it 's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged xxmaj sean xxmaj bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns .\n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj what this results in of course is a more adventure style approach . xxmaj the concentration is less on the workings of the xxmaj english military with xxmaj sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside , dodging xxmaj french patrols , hob xxunk with the xxmaj spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions . xxmaj sergeant xxmaj harper , his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive . xxmaj strangely enough though , they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of xxmaj harper 's baby . \n",

       "  xxmaj this slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run . xxmaj and should anyone be worried that there wo n't be the standard battle at the climax fret not , because once again the poor old xxmaj french get a right kicking . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj ducos makes a fantastic successor to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate . xxmaj he is a duplicitous , malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of xxmaj raiders of the xxmaj lost xxmaj ark. xxmaj elsewhere , xxmaj hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you 'd want to deliver your first born , even if he does look like a member of xxmaj iron xxmaj maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj in short then , another strong chapter in the xxmaj sharpe series . xxmaj sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film . xxmaj it 's not the best introduction if you 've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to xxmaj sharpe that we do n't normally get to witness : the action hero rather than the professional soldier . xxmaj and if that 's not enough to get you tempted , it 's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged xxmaj sean xxmaj bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns .\n",
